# Apparat

Welcome to Apparat- an entity and component based game framework for haxe! Apparat is built on OpenFL and also includes a ton of boilerplate code that allows you to focus on what really matters - your game! Being based on entities and components, Apparat is very easy to extend and reuse.

Features:

 * easy extendable component based framework
 * nestable entities for easy manipulation of groups
 * lots of premade components and entities
 * fast 2D rendering
 * automated collision detection and response
 * atlases, animations and tilemaps
 * recording and replaying of input sequences
 * automatic panning and volume of moving sounds
 * exact mouse and keyboard input
 * fancy text rendering
 * handy math and string routines
 * effective object pools
 * useful logging
 * persistent storage to lower memory foot print
 * and much more
	
	
Apparat is under development. If you have any ideas on how to make it better or any feedback at all. Please let me know!

Thank you!<br/>
